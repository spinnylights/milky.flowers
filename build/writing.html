                    at once mice and butterflies swept apart<br />

                    when he offered to eat<br />

                    threw an owl<br />

                    I had never seen it<br />
                    <br />
                    so the owl<br />
                    was a rare treat<br />
                    and I watched<br />
                    for two hours<br />
                    <br />
                    I did not make it on time<br />

                    o you spectre appearing as that old sawdust plays<br />
                    <br />
                    o you gigantic sepia pollen grain<br />
                    o you sideways spatial rectangular area filling sideways with water<br />
                    <br />
                    o! how you revolve!<br />
                    o! how you fill sideways with water!<br />
                    <br />
                    or some other<br />
                    clear liquid!<br />
                    <br />
                    once you told me<br />
                    I should've been<br />
                    a prophet<br />
                    two or three thousand<br />
                    behind the "eight ball<br />
                    <br />
                    when cobalt lines<br />
                    glid from your tapestry<br />
                    and I revolved and<br />
                    my eyes sang<br />
                    and I<br />
                    could not be touched<br />
                    <br />
